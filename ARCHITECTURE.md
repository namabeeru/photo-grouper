# Photo Grouper - Architecture

> **AI AGENT INSTRUCTION**: You must read this file before starting any major refactor. If you change the tech stack or add a new major feature, you MUST update this file to reflect the new state of the project.

---

## Project Overview

**Photo Grouper** is a privacy-first photo collage maker web application. It allows users to create beautiful photo collages without uploading photos to any server. All image processing happens locally in the browser.

### Core Philosophy
- **Privacy-First**: Photos never leave the user's device
- **Offline-Capable**: Works as a PWA with service worker support
- **Client-Side Processing**: All image manipulation happens in the browser

## Application Flow

The app operates as a **three-phase state machine**:

```
┌──────────┐    Select    ┌─────────────┐    Group It    ┌──────────┐
│   Home   │ ──────────▶ │  Selection  │ ────────────▶ │  Editor  │
└──────────┘    Photos    └─────────────┘                └──────────┘
                                │                             │
                                │◀────── Cancel ──────────────┘
```

| Phase | Component | Description |
|-------|-----------|-------------|
| `home` | `HomePage.tsx` | Welcome screen with "Select Photos" CTA |
| `selection` | `PhotoSelection.tsx` | Photo picker with add/remove functionality |
| `editor` | `CollageEditor.tsx` | Template selection, photo arrangement, save |

## Key Features

### 1. Image Compression
- Uses `browser-image-compression` library
- Settings: `maxSizeMB: 1.5`, `maxWidthOrHeight: 1920`, `useWebWorker: true`
- Prevents app freeze when handling large images

### 2. Collage Templates
- Defined in `utils/templates.ts`
- Support for 2-9 photos with many layout options each (~4-7 per count)
- Each template has: `id`, `name`, `slots`, `aspectRatio`, `style`
- Styles: `clean`, `polaroid`, `rounded`, `artistic`

### 3. Per-Photo Editing (Adjust tab + touch gestures)
- Each slot can be tapped to open inline edit controls
- Adjustments: rotation, zoom (scale), pan (offsetX/Y), brightness, contrast,
  saturation, blur
- **Touch gestures** (Pointer Events on each slot in `EditableSlot`):
  - tap → select the slot
  - one-finger drag → reposition (pan) the photo, at any zoom level
  - two-finger pinch → zoom (pan follows). Rotation is intentionally NOT part
    of the pinch, to avoid the accidental "skew" that twisting introduces;
    rotate precisely via the Adjust buttons/slider instead.
  - long-press (~400ms, with haptic) → arm the slot for swapping; the next tap
    on another slot swaps them. A "Swap…" button in the Adjust tab arms it too.
    Swap is an explicit mode so it never conflicts with pan/zoom (the earlier
    drag-to-swap broke once a photo was zoomed, since drag then meant "pan").
- **Pan is bounded** (`maxOffsetPct` / `clampOffsets` in `utils/photoEdits.ts`):
  offsets are clamped to the image's overflow so panning never reveals empty
  space, and zooming back out re-clamps so edges that were pushed off-frame
  return into view. A `ResizeObserver` re-clamps on layout/aspect changes.
- Edits are stored as a `Map<slotId, PhotoEdits>` in page-level state
- Reset clears the slot back to defaults
- Reassigning a layout resets all edits (slot IDs may not map cleanly)

### 4. Instagram-Style Filters (Filters tab)
- Defined in `utils/photoEdits.ts` (`FILTER_OPTIONS`, `FILTER_PRESETS`)
- Presets: Mono, Noir, Sepia, Vintage, Fade, Warm, Cool, Vivid, Dramatic,
  Cinematic, Pastel, Lush, Matte (plus Original)
- Live thumbnails per preset render the selected photo with the filter via
  CSS `filter`
- `Apply to all` propagates the active filter to every slot
- Canvas export uses `ctx.filter` so JPEG output matches preview

### 5. Output Aspect Ratio (Format tab)
- `ASPECT_PRESETS` in `utils/photoEdits.ts` — platform-targeted ratios
  (Instagram 1:1 / 4:5, Story 9:16, YouTube/X 16:9, Pinterest 2:3,
  Facebook 1.91:1, 4:3, plus "Layout" = the template's own ratio)
- Stored as `outputAspectRatio: number | null` in page state; because slots
  are percentage-based they reflow to whatever ratio is chosen
- Applied to both the editor preview and the export canvas

### 6. Collage Style (Style tab)
- Background colour swatches + free colour picker
- Sliders for photo gap, corner radius, outer padding
- Stored as `CollageStyle` in page-level state, applied both in editor and
  during export

### 7. Canvas-Based Export
- `utils/collageGenerator.ts` renders collages using HTML Canvas API
- Preloads all photos in parallel (`preloadImages`) before drawing
- Replicates the CSS pipeline: cover-fit → clamped translate → scale → rotate,
  then applies `ctx.filter` and clips with rounded rects
- Honors the output aspect-ratio override
- Editor px values (gap/padding/radius) scale via
  `EXPORT_WIDTH / REFERENCE_WIDTH (448)` so output matches preview

### 7. PWA Support
- Configured via `next-pwa` in `next.config.ts`
- Service worker generated for offline capability
- Web manifest at `/public/site.webmanifest`

## State Management

- **No external state library** - Uses React's built-in `useState` and `useCallback`
- All state is managed in `app/page.tsx` and passed down as props
- Key state:
  - `phase`: Current app phase (`home` | `selection` | `editor`)
  - `photos`: Array of `PhotoData` objects with file & preview URL
  - `selectedTemplate`: Currently active collage template
  - `photoAssignments`: `Map<slotId, photoIndex>`
  - `slotEdits`: `Map<slotId, PhotoEdits>` — per-slot rotation/zoom/pan/filter
  - `collageStyle`: `CollageStyle` — background, gap, corner radius, padding

---

## Styling

- **Tailwind CSS v4** for utility-first styling
- **Geist font family** (Sans + Mono) via `next/font/google`
- Dark theme by default (`#1a1a2e` theme color)

---

## Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev     # Start dev server (Turbopack)
npm run build   # Production build
npm run start   # Start production server
npm run lint    # Run ESLint
```

---

## Deployment

- Designed for static/edge deployment
- Recommended platform: **Vercel**
- No server-side data storage or API routes

---

## Future Considerations

When adding new features, consider:

1. **Maintain Privacy**: Any new feature must continue to process data client-side only
2. **PWA Compatibility**: Ensure new features work offline
3. **Template System**: New layouts should follow the `CollageTemplate` interface
4. **Performance**: Use image compression and web workers for heavy operations
